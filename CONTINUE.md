# CONTINUE - Breakfast Run

**Stamped:** 2026-11-14 10:57 SAST · machine: Claude cloud container · branch: claude/breakfast-run-layout-ik0vpe (not yet merged to main) · commit: see `git log -1`
**Lifecycle:** Active

**Status:** Track 1, BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S. Small 16 x 16 cars; the window 176 x 144 in a slim
blue frame; LAYOUT G3 BUILT (docs/design/g3_built.png): logo top right, the mini-map under it, the
race order rows 10-19, bottom left your face and big place in a red block with a white strip (PRESS
Q / LAP n/3 / FINAL LAP / FINISHED!) and the time, the crew chief's bubble (rows 20-23), the L2
start lights hanging in the window, your NOS as small canisters in the window's corner. Your car:
the Skid Lab grip model, the heading settling on the pictured one; set-up keys 1 2 3 before the
start (not shown on screen). `bash build.sh` -> build/racer.tap.

**Speed:** tests/zxlap.py (zxdev). Now: 3 frames x 301, 4 x 12; 15.5 pictures a second off the
grid. Grant, 14 Nov: "speed of the game is good" - no speed hunt owed.

**Memory:** main area about 0.7 KB free (code_end 0xBD1D). The big cars do not fit.

**Next step:** Grant to playtest the tape with his sound picks built (Spilt Milk as buzz in the
interrupt; putter, short screech, crunch, bonk on an O, coin run, whoosh up) and say whether the
ditty stays or one of the four new ones (5-8 in the Sound Lab, https://claude.ai/artifact/5DjCUne3uxZ7dZvpd48HNS,
built by tools/make_sound_lab.py) replaces it: `python3 tools/make_music.py dittyN` then
`bash build.sh`. GRIP is what cuts the skidding (level 1 slides a lot). In design, not built:
coloured objects beside the track seen from above (docs/design/colour_objects.png); the title /
attract screen (docs/design/TITLE-SCREEN.md, title_*.png/gif). Also asked: a bigger gameplay
area still. Watch: pictures at 4 frames when you race in the pack (PROJECT-LOG, 14 Nov later).

**Open:** the set-up is yours only - "rock/paper/scissors" needs the computer cars to have
set-ups too (C_PACE and the skid are their only knobs today); GRIP's step is small in the test
(52 against 55 frames of slide); the race time shows whole seconds (the mock-up had tenths);
Grant to touch up the big cars' 22.5 and 45 headings in the car editor
(https://claude.ai/artifact/2EqdSKs3fDfUqERTX9pTzL, Big cars mode); no zx.project yet for
`zxdev check`.

**Tools:** build: `bash build.sh` (pasmo + the zxspectrum skill's build.sh). Tests: drive_test,
nos_test, o_test, setup_test (zx package); zxlap (zxdev - build ../zx-emulator with
`sh build-linux.sh`; LIST=routine, FINE=n, SLOW=1 for detail); profile_ticks (stage split). Car

**Constraints:** memory - see MEMORY IS FULL above; the copier ends 0xF8E2. Big-car frames fill 0x5F00-0x7FFF
(contended memory) and spill into data.asm. Big cars 0-3 below the
program at 0x5F00 (contended memory). Code before hud.asm must not use equs defined later (pasmo
first-pass values). The interrupt may land while the cloth fill has SP in the buffer: it may push
only 6 bytes (A, H, L only). The cloth fill uses IY and the other register set; the copier uses
the other BC, DE, HL. A test that writes a car's place can race the game's own move (o_test).

**Waiting on Grant:** playtest this build; say whether to merge the branch to main (a pull request
has not been opened); touch-ups to the big cars' angled headings; confirm the repo should be
public; push a tag from his machine (cloud sessions cannot push tags).

Track names for later tracks (verified): The Breakfast Club, Green Eggs and Ham, The Dish Ran Away
with the Spoon, Paddington's Marmalade, Goldilocks' Porridge, Breakfast in America.
