# Breakfast Run - project log

Authoritative log for this workstream (house rule 5.2). Newest at the bottom. Times SAST.

## 2026-11-09 15:20 - started
- Grant: build a top-down car game on the ZX Spectrum as a personal home project to learn
  Spectrum coding; likes Ironman Super Off Road and Super Sprint, wants something like Micro Machines.
- Identity: Personal (chat ran on grant@ttro.com; filing follows the owner). Repo: grant-cmyk/breakfastrun.
- Original game in the genre - no names, art or tracks from the games named.

## 2026-11-09 15:25 - stage 1 built (cloud session, Claude)
- src/racer.asm: one car, 16 headings, 8.8 fixed-point momentum, friction 1/8 road, 1/4 grass,
  XOR sprite at any pixel, attribute read for surface, screen-edge stops.
- tools/make_data.py generates src/data.asm: thrust table, 16 car frames (PLACEHOLDER art,
  maths-generated), 32x24 track attributes (oval, red/white kerbs, start line).
- tests/drive_test.py on the real 48K ROM (zx 0.13.15): 10/10 PASS. One failure on the first run
  was the test's own fault (held O 17 frames, angle wrapped past 0); fixed the test, not the game.
- Not playtested by Grant yet. Known: possible flicker (erase+redraw per frame), placeholder car.

## 2026-11-09 15:29 SAST - named Breakfast Run
